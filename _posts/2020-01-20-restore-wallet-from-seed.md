## You want to get your wallet back and you have your seed

1. Click on the + button on the main screen.
2. Choose *Restore wallet 25 word seed*.
3. Choose a name and password for you wallet.
4. Enter your 25 word mnemonic seed.
5. Enter a restore height or a date you’re sure it’s prior to the wallet’s creation, otherwise some transactions may not appear on your transactions list.
6. Click on *MAKE ME A WALLET ALREADY*
7. Done. Monerujo will need to sync your wallet (scan the blockchain for transactions belonging to you). Duration will be proportional to how far away in time you’re making it check for them.
